# Integration tests

These tests are supposed to run via GitHub Actions on different OS (Linux, MacOS and Windows)
against all possible Python versions.
You can still run them yourself on your OS with your currently installed Python version.

Use the `Makefile` in the root directory to do so:
```bash
make test
```
